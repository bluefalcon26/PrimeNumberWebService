# PrimeNumberWebService

Create a web application that will generate the first 1000 prime numbers beginning with 2. The

application should generate an array of primes in any modern server-side language and

respond as a web service to a call from the client-side AJAX request. Feel free to use any

libraries or packages that you would use for any normal project, we encourage using toolkits

like Bootstrap, Bower, npm, Grunt, etc.

Once you've completed the project please respond with a link to the Github repository.

Create a Github repository for your code.
